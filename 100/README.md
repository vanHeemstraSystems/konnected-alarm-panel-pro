# 100 - Introduction

After attempting to get our Ademco Vista Alarm Panel to be connected via Alarm Grid to the Internet, and mobile App, the project was not satisfactory yet. Hence, Konnected Alarm Panel Pro is an improvement that will reuse all sensors, siren, etc. of our wired alarm system whilst giving it direct access from the Internet (via Home Assistant) and mobile App.
